# Web Development Training Project

## Explanation
This project is a sandbox I use to **train web development** and test out different ideas.  
Itâ€™s not polished or production-ready â€” view (and weep) at your own discretion. ðŸ™‚

##  How to Run Locally
Clone the repository and run the Flask app:

```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/Legmont/Webapp_Training_Project.git
cd Webapp_Training_Project
```
Install [uv packet manager](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) 
Install the required dependencies with
```bash
uv sync
```
And run with
```bash
uv run main.py
```
Now you can view the flask app in your browser under http://127.0.0.1:5000
